# **HW4 Handout**

In this assignment, we are introducing a new format for assignment delivery, designed to enhance your development workflow. The key motivations for this change are:

- **Test Suite Integration**: Your code will be tested in a manner similar to `HWP1's`.
- **Local Development**: You will be able to perform most of your initial development locally, reducing the need for compute resources.
- **Hands-on Experience**: This assignment provides an opportunity to build an end-to-end deep learning pipeline from scratch. We will be substantially reducing the amount of abstractions compared to previous assignments.

For our provided notebook's to work, your notebook's current working directory must be the same as the handout.
This is important because the relative imports in the notebook's depend on the current working directory.
This can be achieved by:

1. Physically moving the notebook's into the handout directory.
2. Changing the notebook's current working directory to the handout directory using the `os.chdir()` function.

Your current working directory should have the following files for this assignment:

```
.
├── README.md
├── hw4lib/
├── mytorch/
├── tests/
├── hw4_data_subset/
└── requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset Structure

We have provided a subset of the dataset for you to use. This subset has been provided with the intention of allowing you to implement and test your code locally. The subset follows the same structure as the original dataset and is organized as follows:

```
hw4_data_subset/
├── hw4p1_data/ # For causal language modeling
│ ├── train/
│ ├── valid/
│ └── test/
└── hw4p2_data/ # For end-to-end speech recognition
├── dev-clean/
│ ├── fbank/
│ └── text/
├── test-clean/
│ └── fbank/
└── train-clean-100/
├── fbank/
└── text/

```

## 🔧 Implementation Files

### Main Library (`hw4lib/`)

For `HW4P1` and `HW4P2`, you will incrementally implement components of `hw4lib` to build and train two models:

- **HW4P1**: A _Decoder-only Transformer_ for causal language modeling.
- **HW4P2**: An _Encoder-Decoder Transformer_ for end-to-end speech recognition.

Many of the components you implement will be reusable across both parts, reinforcing modular design and efficient implementation. You should see the following files in the `hw4lib/` directory (`__init__.py`'s are not shown):

```
hw4lib/
├── data/
│ ├── tokenizer_jsons/
│ ├── asr_dataset.py
│ ├── lm_dataset.py
│ └── tokenizer.py
├── decoding/
│ └── sequence_generator.py
├── model/
│ ├── masks.py
│ ├── positional_encoding.py
│ ├── speech_embedding.py
│ ├── sublayers.py
│ ├── decoder_layers.py
│ ├── encoder_layers.py
│ └── transformers.py
├── trainers/
│  ├── base_trainer.py
│  ├── asr_trainer.py
│  └── lm_trainer.py
└── utils/
   ├── create_lr_scheduler.py
   └── create_optimizer.py
```

### MyTorch Library Components (`mytorch/`)

In `HW4P1` and `HW4P2`, you will build and train Transformer models using PyTorch’s `nn.MultiHeadAttention`. To deepen your understanding of its internals, you will also implement a custom `MultiHeadAttention` module from scratch as part of your `mytorch` library, designed to closely match the PyTorch interface. You should see the following files in the `mytorch/` directory:

```

mytorch/nn/
├── activation.py
├── linear.py
├── scaled_dot_product_attention.py
└── multi_head_attention.py

```

### Test Suite (`tests/`)

In `HW4P1` and `HW4P2`, you will be provided with a test suite that will be used to test your implementation. You should see the following files in the `tests/` directory:

```

tests/
├── testing_framework.py
├── test_mytorch*.py
├── test_dataset*.py
├── test_mask*.py
├── test_positional_encoding.py
├── test_sublayers*.py
├── test_encoderlayers*.py
├── test_decoderlayers*.py
├── test_transformers\*.py
├── test_hw4p1.py
└── test_decoding.py

```

## Setup

Follow the setup instructions based on your preferred environment!

### Local

One of our key goals in designing this assignment is to allow you to complete most of the preliminary implementation work locally.  
We highly recommend that you **pass all tests locally** using the provided `hw4_data_subset` before moving to a GPU runtime.  
To do this, simply:

#### Step 1: Create a new conda environment

```bash
# Be sure to deactivate any active environments first
conda create -n hw4 python=3.12.4
```

#### Step 2: Activate the conda environment

```bash
conda activate hw4
```

#### Step 3: Install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Ensure that your notebook is in the same working directory as the `Handout`

This can be achieved by:

1. Physically moving the notebook into the handout directory.
2. Changing the notebook’s current working directory to the handout directory using the os.chdir() function.

#### Step 5: Open the notebook and select the newly created environment from the kernel selector.

If everything was done correctly, You should see atleast the following files in your current working directory after running `!ls`:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── hw4lib/
├── mytorch/
├── tests/
└── hw4_data_subset/
```

### Colab

#### Step 1: Get your handout

- See writeup for recommended approaches.

##### Example: My preferred approach

```python
import os

# Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Token (classic)
os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN'] = "your-token"

GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-username"
REPO_NAME = "IDL-HW4"
TOKEN = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
repo_url = f"https://{TOKEN}@github.com/{GITHUB_USERNAME}/{REPO_NAME}.git"
!git clone {repo_url}

## -------------

# To pull latest changes (Must be in the repo dir, use pwd/ls to verify)
!cd {REPO_NAME} && git pull
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

- `NOTE`: Your runtime will be restarted to ensure all dependencies are updated.
- `NOTE`: You will see a runtime crashed message, this was intentionally done. Simply move on to the next cell.

```python
%pip install --no-deps -r IDL-HW4/requirements.txt
import os
# NOTE: This will restart the your colab Python runtime (required)!
os.kill(os.getpid(), 9)
```

#### Step 3: Obtain Data

- `NOTE`: This process will automatically download and unzip data for both `HW4P1` and `HW4P2`.

```bash
!curl -L -o /content/f25-hw4-data.zip https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cmu11785/f25-11785-hw4-data
!unzip -q -o /content/f25-hw4-data.zip -d /content/hw4_data
!rm -rf /content/f25-hw4-data.zip
!du -h --max-depth=2 /content/hw4_data
```

#### Step 4: Move to Handout Directory

```python
import os
os.chdir('IDL-HW4')
!ls
```

You must be within the handout directory for the library imports to work!

- `NOTE`: You may have to repeat running this command anytime you restart your runtime.
- `NOTE`: You can do a `pwd` to check if you are in the right directory.
- `NOTE`: The way it is setup currently, Your data directory should be one level up from your project directory. Keep this in mind when you are setting your `root` in the config file.

If everything was done correctly, You should see atleast the following files in your current working directory after running `!ls`:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── hw4lib/
├── mytorch/
├── tests/
└── hw4_data_subset/
```

### Kaggle

While it is possible to run the notebook on Kaggle, we would recommend against it. This assignment is more resource intensive and may run slower on Kaggle.

#### Step 1: Get your handout

- See writeup for recommended approaches.

##### Example: My preferred approach

```python
import os

# Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Token (classic)
os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN'] = "your-token"

GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-username"
REPO_NAME = "IDL-HW4"
TOKEN = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
repo_url = f"https://{TOKEN}@github.com/{GITHUB_USERNAME}/{REPO_NAME}.git"
!git clone {repo_url}

## -------------

# To pull latest changes (Must be in the repo dir, use pwd/ls to verify)
!cd {REPO_NAME} && git pull
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Simply set the `Environment` setting in the notebook to `Always use latest environment`. No need to install anything.

### Step 3: Obtain Data

#### ⚠️ Important: Kaggle Users  
If you are using Kaggle, **do not manually download the data!** The dataset is large and may exceed your available disk space. Instead, follow these steps to add the dataset directly to your notebook:

1. Open your **Kaggle Notebook**.  
2. Navigate to **Notebook → Input**.  
3. Click **Add Input**.  
4. In the search bar, paste the following URL:  
   👉 [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cmu11785/f25-11785-hw4-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cmu11785/f25-11785-hw4-data)  
5. Click the **➕ (plus sign)** to add the dataset to your notebook.  

#### 📌 Note:  
This process will automatically download and unzip data for both `HW4P1` and `HW4P2`.  


#### Step 4: Move to Handout Directory

```python
import os
os.chdir('IDL-HW4')
!ls
```

You must be within the handout directory for the library imports to work!

- `NOTE`: You may have to repeat running this command anytime you restart your runtime.
- `NOTE`: You can do a `pwd` to check if you are in the right directory.
- `NOTE`: The way it is setup currently, Your data directory should be one level up from your project directory. Keep this in mind when you are setting your `root` in the config file.

If everything was done correctly, You should see atleast the following files in your current working directory after running `!ls`:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── hw4lib/
├── mytorch/
├── tests/
└── hw4_data_subset/
```

### PSC
### 1️⃣ **Step 1 Setting Up Your Environment on Bridges2**

❗️⚠️ For this homework, we are **providing shared Datasets and a shared Conda environment** for the entire class.

❗️⚠️ So for PSC users, **do not download the data yourself** and **do not need to manually install the packages**!

Follow these steps to set up the environment and start a Jupyter notebook on Bridges2:

To run your notebook more efficiently on PSC, we need to use a **Jupyter Server** hosted on a compute node.

You can use your prefered way of connecting to the Jupyter Server. Your options should be covered in the docs linked in post 558 @ piazza.

**The recommended way of connecting is:**

#### **Connect in VSCode**
SSH into Bridges2 and navigate to your **Jet directory** (`Jet/home/<your_psc_username>`). Upload your notebook there, and then connect to the Jupyter Server from that directory.

#### **1. SSH into Bridges2**
1) Open VS Code and click on the `Extensions` icon in the left sidebar. Make sure the "**Remote - SSH**" extension is installed.

2) Open the command palette (**Shift+Command+P** on Mac, **Ctrl+Shift+P** on Windows). A search box will appear at the top center. Choose `"Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host"`, then enter:

```bash
ssh <your_username>@bridges2.psc.edu #change <your_username> to your username
```

Next, choose `"/Users/<your_username>/.ssh/config"` as the config file. A dialog will appear in the bottom right saying "Host Added". Click `"Connect"`, and then enter your password.

(Note: After adding the host once, you can later use `"Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"` and select "bridges2.psc.edu" from the list.)

3) Once connected, click `"Explorer"` in the left sidebar > "Open Folder", and navigate to your home directory under the project grant:
```bash
/jet/home/<your_username>  #change <your_username> to your username
```

4) You can now drag your notebook files directly into the right-hand pane (your remote home directory), or upload them using `scp` into your folder.

❗️⚠️ The following steps should be executed in the **VSCode integrated terminal**.
 
#### **2. Navigate to Your Directory**
Make sure to use this `/jet/home/<your_username>` as your working directory, since all subsequent operations (up to submission) are based on this path.
```bash
cd /jet/home/<your_username>  #change <your_username> to your username
```

#### **3. Request a Compute Node**
```bash
interact -p GPU-shared --gres=gpu:v100-32:1 -t 8:00:00 -A cis250019p
```

#### **4. Load the Anaconda Module**
```bash
module load anaconda3
```

#### **5. Activate the provided HW4 Environment**
```bash
conda deactivate # First, deactivate any existing Conda environment
conda activate /ocean/projects/cis250019p/mzhang23/TA/HW4/envs/hw4_env && export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
```

#### **6. Start Jupyter Notebook**
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
```

Go to **Kernel** → **Select Another Kernel** → **Existing Jupyter Server**
   Enter the URL of the Jupyter Server:```http://{hostname}:{port}/tree?token={token}```
   
   *(Usually, this URL appears in the terminal output after you run `jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0`, in a line like:  “Jupyter Server is running at: http://...”)*

   - eg: `http://v011.ib.bridges2.psc.edu:8888/tree?token=e4b302434e68990f28bc2b4ae8d216eb87eecb7090526249`

**Note**: Replace `{hostname}`, `{port}` and `{token}` with your actual values from the Jupyter output.

After launching the Jupyter notebook, you can run the cells directly inside the notebook — no need to use the terminal for the remaining steps.

### 2️⃣ Step 2: Get Repo

#Make sure you are in your directory
!pwd #should be /jet/home/<your_username>, if not, uncomment the following line and replace with your actual username:
# %cd /jet/home/<your_username>
#TODO: replace the "<your_username>" to yours

# Example: Preferred approach

```bash
import os
# Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens -> Token (classic)
os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN'] = "your_github_token_here"
GITHUB_USERNAME = "your_github_username_here"
REPO_NAME       = "your_github_repo_name_here"
TOKEN = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
repo_url        = f"https://{TOKEN}@github.com/{GITHUB_USERNAME}/{REPO_NAME}.git"
!git clone {repo_url}

# To pull latest changes (Must be in the repo dir, use pwd/ls to verify)
!cd {REPO_NAME} && git pull
```

#### **Move to Project Directory**
- `NOTE`: You may have to repeat this on anytime you restart your runtime. You can do a `pwd` or `ls` to check if you are in the right directory.

```bash
import os
os.chdir('IDL-HW4')
!ls
```

### 3️⃣ **Step 3: Set up Kaggle API Authentication**

```bash
# TODO: Use the same Kaggle code from HW3P2
!mkdir /jet/home/<your_username>/.kaggle #TODO: replace the "<your_username>" to yours

with open("/jet/home/<your_username>/.kaggle/kaggle.json", "w+") as f: #TODO: replace the "<your_username>" to yours
    f.write('{"username":"<your_username>","key":"<your_key>"}')
    # TODO: Put your kaggle username & key here

!chmod 600 /jet/home/<your_username>/.kaggle/kaggle.json #TODO: replace the "<your_username>" to yours
```

### 4️⃣ **Step 4: Get Data**

❗️⚠️ The data used in this assignment is **already stored in a shared, read-only folder, so you do not need to manually download anything**.

Instead, just make sure to replace the dataset path in your notebook code with the correct path from the shared directory.

You can run the following block to explore the shared directory structure:

```bash
import os
data_path = "/ocean/projects/cis250019p/mzhang23/TA/HW4/hw4p1_data" #Shared data path, do not need to change the username to yours
print("Files in shared hw4p2 dataset:", os.listdir(data_path))
```

```bash
!apt-get install tree
!tree -L 2 /ocean/projects/cis250019p/mzhang23/TA/HW4/hw4p1_data
```
